## Project Description
AppamScope is a whimsical web application that uses Google's Gemini AI to analyze an image of a South Indian Appam pancake. It generates a creative, personalized horoscope based on the unique patterns of holes and textures, offering users a fun and novel way to get their "daily reading."

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
For too long, humanity has looked to the stars for guidance, completely ignoring the cosmic wisdom embedded in our breakfast foods. The ancient, profound art of Appamancyâ€”divining the future from the craters of a fermented rice pancakeâ€”has been lost to the ages. This has left a gaping, appam-shaped hole in modern divination practices.

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
AppamScope is here to right this historical wrong! By simply uploading a photo of their appam, users can tap into our powerful AI oracle, AppamScopus. The AI analyzes the image, identifies a corresponding zodiac sign, and generates a delightful, pun-filled horoscope. It's astrology, but with more coconut milk.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
- *Languages:* TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- *Framework:* React.js
- *Styling:* Tailwind CSS
- *Core AI Service:* Google Gemini API (@google/genai) for image-to-text and controlled JSON generation.
- *Runtime Environment:* A modern web browser with ES Module support.

## Implementation
### Installation
No complex installation is needed! The project is a client-side application that runs directly in the browser.

However, to use the Gemini API, an API key must be available. It is assumed that the process.env.API_KEY environment variable is set in the deployment environment.

### Run
1.  Serve the project files using a simple local server.
2.  Open index.html in a web browser.
3.  The application will be ready to use.
